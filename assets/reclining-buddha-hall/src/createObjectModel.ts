 * `three` is imported as a bare specifier and NOTHING else. The bundle is CommonJS with a bare
 * require("three") and the host page injects its OWN three instance; a second copy means this

 * instancing and the lathe helpers below are hand-rolled -- anything under three/examples/jsm is
 * a second import.
 *
 * Envelope 14.00 x 10.00 x 28.00 m, origin base-center, +Y up, long axis on Z.
 * Budget (hero4x): <=32000 triangles, <=24 draw calls, <=16 materials, <=32 unique geometries.
 *
 * This is one of thaikit's MONUMENTAL buildings, and unlike the shared retail module its form is
 * not a box: the recognisable feature is a curved or tiered profile that has to survive at the
 * distance a village skyline is read from. The shared vocabulary here is therefore the LATHE --
 * a profile revolved about +Y -- and the tiered/stepped merge, not the parameterised shopfront.
