/**
 * Chinese Shrine -- procedural Three.js factory.

 * `three` is imported as a bare specifier and NOTHING else. The bundle is CommonJS with a bare
 * require("three") and the host page injects its OWN three instance; a second copy means this
 * file's Mesh is not the renderer's Mesh and nothing draws. That is also why geometry merging,
 * instancing and the lathe helpers below are hand-rolled -- anything under three/examples/jsm is
 * a second import.
 *
 * Envelope 10.00 x 8.00 x 12.00 m, origin base-center, +Y up, long axis on Z.
 * Budget (hero2x): <=16000 triangles, <=12 draw calls, <=8 materials, <=32 unique geometries.
 *
 * This is one of thaikit's MONUMENTAL buildings, and unlike the shared retail module its form is
 * not a box: the recognisable feature is a curved or tiered profile that has to survive at the
 * distance a village skyline is read from. The shared vocabulary here is therefore the LATHE --
 * a profile revolved about +Y -- and the tiered/stepped merge, not the parameterised shopfront.
